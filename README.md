ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Detection using CNN
This project implements an AI-based Plant Disease Detection System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
The model analyzes leaf images and classifies them as healthy or diseased, helping farmers and researchers in early disease diagnosis.

ðŸŒ± Features
Classifies plant leaves into healthy and diseased categories

Supports multiple disease types if the dataset contains them

Uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification

Visualizes training and validation accuracy/loss


ðŸ“¦ Dependencies
Python 3.8+

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

scikit-learn
